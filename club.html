                <p> I was a member in robotics club and cs in IEEE
                    participating in IEEE activities was excellent way to
                    enhance my skills In a robotics club, we work on hands-on
                    projects, , and I gained practical experience in designing
                    and building robots I developed problem-solving skills and
                    applied theoretical knowledge to real-world scenarios On the
                    computer science side I have been involved in coding,
                    software development, algorithms, and other aspects of
                    computing.
